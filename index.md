## About me

Hi, I am Philipp. I am currently working as a developer with a interdisciplinary overlap between data ethics, data governance and data science.

I am a very curious person which is why I have even two main fields of interesst I love to work in:
- Journalism: I am interested in journalism, especially the intersection of quantitative methods and visualization with qualitative journalistic storytelling.
- Video Games: My other big passion is developing video games, where many different art forms come together.
